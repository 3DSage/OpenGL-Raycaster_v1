# OpenGL-Raycaster_v1

These are all suggesstions for the original repo by 3D Sage. Original code isn't mine only whats been improved on in this repo

This is the code from my YouTube video! 
I still recommend watching the video so you follow along and see what each part does and how it works but here is the code if you need help. Thank you for the support, postive feedback, and comments! 
Note: Keep the window size the same as it opens to look correct.
